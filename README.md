## Hi, I'm Tim.
### I'm a full-stack software engineer at Amazon working on iOS, Android, Web, and back-end services. I cofounded and built [SlideNotes](https://slidenotes.dev) a generative AI web application that turns slides into notes. I am a former SpaceX RFIC Silicon Sofware Engineering Intern, former Amazon Software Development Engineer Intern and former Tech Lead of [humanID](https://human-id.org), a non-profit startup backed by Harvard Business School and Mozilla.
