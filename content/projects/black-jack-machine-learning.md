This program uses a reinforcement based learning algorithim to teach the computer to play black jack. The first line gives the percentage change that the computer will hit on the number given in the second line. The third line, in order, shows the number of the last 100 games won, the percent of the last 10000 games won, and the percent of the first 10000 games won. The fourth line shows the percent growth in games won. This project is available on github [here](https://github.com/timhradil/Black-Jack-Machine-Learning) or can be previewed below via repl.it.
