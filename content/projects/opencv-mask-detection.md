This program uses a users webcam in order to determine whether or not they are wearing a mask. It does this with a custom trained cascade classifier (cascade.xml) using training data available online. There is a video demo down below and the code is available on github [here](https://github.com/timhradil/OpenCV-Mask-Detection).
